                Ms. Bendig is the Founder of Present Value Ltd, an advisory and fund management services firm catering to institutional and strategic investors, including the IFC / World Bank, AfricInvest and Carlyle.  She has also served on the boards of numerous private, growth-focused corporates in emerging and frontier nations.  Prior to forming her own advisory firm, she held senior roles with prestigious companies such as Credit Agricole, UBS, and Arthur D. Little, mostly in Asia.  Professional highlights include underpinning transactions of up to US $800 million and fast-tracking financial institutions into top tier positions based on industry and target client metrics.  Her accomplished global career in financial services and value creation has enabled her to become adroit in problem-solving, negotiations, and transactions, including portfolio exits.   
                /n /n
                With a proven track record for corporate transformation, completing deals and fund-raising, investment institutions and corporates in Africa, Asia and the U.S. have proactively sought out her advisory services.  Key to her success has been her ability to rapidly build effective relationships, align with critical metrics and integrate solid ESG practices within diverse, multi-cultural environments.  As an early advocate for Climate Change (publishing India Warming in 2008), many value creation strategies incorporated pollution mitigation measures alongside mainstream expansion initiatives.  
                /n /n
                Recent project accomplishments include her appointment as a trusted advisor and Fund Manager to a West Africa private equity fund within the IFC’s pioneering SME Ventures Program’s investment portfolio.  After substantial restructuring, exits of 28 of 32 of the portfolio holdings were negotiated in exceptionally difficult operating jurisdictions, spanning local economic crises, legal complexities and amidst the onset of the COVID pandemic.  Immediately prior to this, she had spearheaded the strategy and comprehensive framework to cost-effectively upscale the Program’s broader fund deployment efforts by 4-5x to US$1.4 billion, factoring in returns targets, risk management hurdles and critical ESG benchmarks, the results of which were presented to the World Bank Board.   
                /n/n
                Ms. Bendig graduated cum laude in BSc degree in Geology and Petroleum Engineering from the University of Texas.  Her research on the scanning electron microscope during her studies supported Dr R. L. Folk on the innovative ‘Life on Mars’ thesis.  Shortly following graduation, she was amongst the first women professionals to work on oil exploration rigs offshore in the Gulf of Mexico before relocating to Asia.
